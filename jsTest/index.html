    QUESTION 4:

    With javascript/jquery build a table listing using the data from the customers array (stored in data.js).
    The listing should show the customer's name and age.
    Above the listing add a textbox.
    Entering a value will search all names which contains the entered string.
    When you search for a number range (20-30) it will filter the results based off the customer's age.
    E.g When you search for 20-30 it must list everyone with ages in that range.
    Please make sure your code runs as effectively as it can.
